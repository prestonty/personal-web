# Preston's Personal Website

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This is my hub world where I showcase some of my projects, share my adventures abroad, and random interests.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The Boring Stuff)

-   **Frontend**: React 18+ Tailwind CSS (because who has time to write CSS from scratch?)
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion + React Spring (making things go brrrr)
-   **3D Stuff**: Three.js + React Three Fiber (was really fun to create and play with)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js
-   npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/prestonty/personal-website.git

# Navigate to the project
cd personal-website

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start the development server
npm start
```

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see my beautiful face staring back at you! 👀

## 🎮 Fun Features

-   **Interactive Laptop**: Click on it and try typing WASD or QWERT
-   **Travel Globe**: Click on different destinations to see my adventures
-   **Responsive Design**: Works on everything from a potato phone to a gaming rig

## 🏆 Projects That Actually Work

-   **InvestoryX** - Stock analytics platform (because money makes the world go round)
-   **TrailMixer** - AI-powered video editor (I actually enjoy video editing sometimes but spend way too long...)
-   **Linguistify** - Video dubbing software (breaking language barriers, one video at a time)
-   **bliss** - Web development project (HackWestern!)
-   **AI Girlfriend** - Don't ask, just check the GitHub 😂

## 🎯 What I'm Up To

Currently studying **Systems Design Engineering @ UWaterloo** and trying to figure out:

-   Backend engineering (scalable systems, databases, all that jazz)
-   Machine learning infrastructure (because AI is the future, right?)
-   How to not break production code (still working on this one)
